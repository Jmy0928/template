			<p>This kind of recommend environmental regulation can truly make some differences. In my home city Beijing, the government limits car ownership by auctioning off license plates each year by lottery every month. I made a conducting with Tong Zhu, an air pollution specialist who teaches at Beijing universities, says the solutions to the problem are no secret and ultimately depend on political leadership.
    "There is technology available," Zhu told me, "I think as long as there is political willingness, the environmental situation can be definitely improved."
     For the 2008 Beijing Olympics, Beijing has actually done a lot to control pollution over the years. In the 1990s, officials pushed industry out of the city and replaced most coal-burning heating with natural gas. “The newest fuel emission standards are even higher than some European cities," Zhu says.
    “Because the Communist Party is an authoritarian regime, we have the impression that the central government controls everything," says Zhu, "but the people like us studied environmental science will be focused and our recommends will be heard seriously by the government".
    A faculty of MSU working in the biology science building-Dechun Wang who did the research about the wages after graduation of environmental discipline. During the interview he told me the aerospace students gets the best wages after graduation, but the students who enroll in the environmental program get a great potential. He lists the Industries with the highest levels and top paying industries employment in this occupation. Obviously, an environment student who have fully design and analysis skills will get better and better wages in the future.
