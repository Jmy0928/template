		<h1>course retrospective project</h1>
		<p>Writing is a part of life and the fundamental of the research. As a engineering students, although writing classes are difficult, they will help you develop as a professional engineer. My first year writing class at Michigan State really helps me a lot. We have done 5 big projects including this one right here. Apparently, each paper had taught me many different ways to improve my literacy skills. To create the projects, students must research, write, read, and communicate. All of the skills are very necessary to be successful in upper level education. 
    I will doing a review and the big picture for the new incoming students on each of these five projects which include the Lived Experiences Project, the Cultural Analysis Project, the Formal Research Project, the Multimedia Remix Project and the Course Retrospective Project. </p>
        <p>The Lived Experiences Project was the first project in this course. I created a narrative detailing how a specific piece of technology has impacted your choice of a career at the present time. You also had to have a story about the piece. Fortunately, I have a exact experience which lead me to biology field during my high school. My story was about SARS. Firstly I described this disease and how severe it is. Then I choose to add more details about the hard time scared by that. Then I mentioned even till now, there is no cure or protective vaccine for SARS which is safe for use in humans. The importance of Biology came to my eyes and I really want to learn better and deeper knowledge. Then I told a story about model cars in the second half. It has always been my favorite thing to do. I explain the relation between model car modification and engineering skills. For example, I used to rebuild the motor of the mode cars, which is the same as we do in the engineering class. This year, when we did the EGR100 lego robot project, we found it’s a very important part in setting a program and remodel the motor. I love doing engineering things.</p>
        <p>The second project, the cultural analysis project was a little harder. The objective of the project is to find a piece of media, TV show, movie, song, anything and then talk about its cultural meaning and the issue it is trying to bring forward. This project was harder because it gives you a ton of freedom on what you are allowed to pick then just find something to talk about in it, but through the analysis of a cultural artifact, you should investigate a specific social issue and its import on society. I choose to talk about selfish and cooperation using a experience in my high school. Firstly I described the game we lost and especially focus on what we thought after lost and how my coach told us. Then I choose to add more details about the hard work training after it and how we finally win the tournament. (In this part I detailed the importance of teamwork and the proposed solution ). After that I showed that we can use the teamwork spirit not only in basketball game but also everywhere when we study and work. I gave some examples such as cooperation at school and when we work in the future we can use the spirit to win big. In the end I reassert my main theme again in the last paragraph and show my determination to develop my teamwork skills. As for me, this assignment is a very good review for me and recall my experience that how to be a succeed man in the future. </p>
        <p>The third project is the formal research report. This was by far the project I learned the most. You get to research the major you have chosen which for most people the field they plan on going into. In this essay, the target is to give students who are new to the academic field you have chosen an introduction to the expectations for writing, reading, and researching in that discipline. For me that field was biology. I knew a little before actually, I just know my aunt works for FDA. In order to do it, I read lots of biology website I could find and I now know everything we will do as a biology researchers. I have a good understanding of what it really takes to be successful in this field eventually. In this project, we are also asked to conduct 2 interviews, one with a person who teaches courses in the field of study, and one with a person who practices in the field. For this requirement, I conducted my aunt’s friend, who is a professor for biology in MSU and a professor in my hometown Beijing. The interview doing well and I learned a lot from them. For the analysis of the paper, it’s a really huge work to do. Luckily, we had an in class activity that helped me out a lot with this project regarding the articles. That in class activity really helped us find the right articles for our papers and also taught us how to search with a purpose by finding articles that relate to our papers with the internet.</p>
        <p>The Multimedia Remix Project was the fourth project. This included a documentary and a memo. It’s really interesting project because we do it in groups. I think the most challenging part of the project is the filming part. We filmed several video parts in meridian mall and I acted as a friend of shopaholic. It’s my first time to act and we had lot’s of conversations. It’s a challenge for me to memory the words and act confidently. Working in groups for this is fruitful. Because firstly it’s more efficient to work in groups. We can distribute the task to everyone so that we can devote more into each’s parts. Then working in groups makes this project interesting. We went to the meridian mall to filmt our remix part. Actually I think it is the most challenging part of the project. We filmed several video parts in meridian mall and I acted as a friend of shopaholic. It’s my first time to act and we had lot’s of conversations. It’s a challenge for me to memory the words and act confidently. lot’s of people are seeing me and I really feel nervous in the mall. I have to say, working in groups for this project is fruitful. Because firstly it’s more efficient to work in groups. We can distribute the task to everyone so that we can devote more into each’s parts. Then working in groups makes this project interesting. There may happened many funny things when we work together and I can imagine feeling boring when filming and remix the video by ourselves. Finally we finished it before due date and upload it to youtube. It’s seems awesome and now it was seen by 20 more people in youtube.com. We feel very proud of it.</p>
        <p>The final project is this one right here. This project consists of two parts. First, and most importantly, you will write a final progress report for this course that revisits and revises your individual literacy history for a specific purpose of revisiting and revising for the purpose of helping incoming students understand the big picture of First-Year Writing to enhance their chances of success in the Program. It’s interesting to rethink the advantages and disadvantages before. As saying goes, wise man reflect themselves three times every day. The second part of the project is to create a website that informs and advises incoming students about WRA 110 using the content generated by the individual papers described above. The website should include an explanation of all four key assignments as well as your advice and admonitions for incoming students. </p>
        <p> For conclusion, Through this course, I learned how to write a story logically and how to collect, analyze and share information. In the end, I learned how to share information and opinions with others, seeing others review can give me confidence and lead me to correct the mistakes. Thanks for giving directions and I hope I can keep improving my writing and analyze skills in the next level course.</p>
