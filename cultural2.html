			<h1>Introduction</h1>
			<p>“In early December 1891, Dr. James Naismith, a physical education professor was trying to keep his gym class active on a rainy day.” He sought a vigorous indoor game to keep his students occupied and at proper levels of fitness during the long winters. After rejecting other ideas as either too rough or poorly suited to walled-in gym. “He wrote the basic rules and nailed a basket onto a 10-foot (3.05 m) elevated track.” In contrast with modern basketball nets, this peach basket retained its bottom, and balls had to be retrieved manually after each "basket" or point scored; this proved inefficient, however, so the bottom of the basket was removed, allowing the balls to be poked out with a long dowel each time.
    “The peach baskets were used until 1906 when they were finally replaced by metal hoops with backboards.” A further change was soon made, so the ball merely passed through. Whenever a person got the ball in the basket, his team would gain a point. Whichever team got the most points won the game. The baskets were originally nailed to the mezzanine balcony of the playing court, but this proved impractical when spectators on the balcony began to interfere with shots. The backboard was introduced to prevent this interference; it had the additional effect of allowing rebound shots. “The first official game was played in the YMCA gymnasium on January 20, 1892 with nine players. The game ended at 1–0; the shot was made from 25 feet (7.6 m), on a court just half the size of a present-day National basketball association (NBA) court.” “By 1897–1898 teams of five became standard.”</p>
