			<h1>Introduction</h1>
			<p> “In early December 1891, Dr. James Naismith, a physical education professor was trying to keep his gym class active on a rainy day.” He sought a vigorous indoor game to keep his students occupied and at proper levels of fitness during the long winters. After rejecting other ideas as either too rough or poorly suited to walled-in gym. “He wrote the basic rules and nailed a basket onto a 10-foot (3.05 m) elevated track.” In contrast with modern basketball nets, this peach basket retained its bottom, and balls had to be retrieved manually after each "basket" or point scored; this proved inefficient, however, so the bottom of the basket was removed, allowing the balls to be poked out with a long dowel each time.

			<h1>Analysis of Artifact</h1>
			<p>One of the hoop speaker called Beckley Mason wrote a passage about “know your role”. He wrote: 
    “I am no psychologist and do not presume to know the root motivations for Wilt’s life. However the style of the book, written conversationally in Wilt’s voice and given to an unstable rhythm of mostly factual narrative and personal introspection, invites such analysis of the decisions he made, and the roles he’d chosen to that point in his life.”
    As articulated by Mile Durkheim, the concept of “roles” in society seeks to explain how the combination of others’ expectations and each individual’s own relationship with those expectations governs our thoughts and behaviors. This tension, sometimes manifested in “social facts” such as laws or religious tenets or social norms, creates social constraints that can have a coercive effect on the behavior of the individual. In Durkheim’s model, it doesn’t matter whether the individual actually assents to these facts. That is, inclusion (whether voluntary or otherwise) in a team, family, group, or as a member of society at large presupposes a constraint on individual will and freedom.
    The idea of roles on the basketball court, as in society, relies to no small degree on tradition. He felt that he was judged too harshly by coaches, teammates and especially “the press,” who he saw as disseminators of bogus that portrayed Wilt as the evil Goliath figure. In the face of unfair perceptions that his physical gifts should allow him to singlehandedly control the outcomes of games, Wilt seems to have focused on what he knew he could control: individual achievements.
    In his basketball life, his teammates often bear these labels–distinct roles demarcate each player’s identity. When teammates failed to perform their jobs, Wilt portrays them as not holding up their end of the bargain. It’s a paradox of teamwork, and one that seems mostly lost on Wilt, that each player must play his role to facilitate team play but that sometimes strict adherence to a particular role can be an unwittingly selfish act of hoop. Maybe it wasn’t Wilt’s role to score big every night for the 1969 Lakers, a squad that also featured legends Jerry West and Elgin Baylor, but heck, would it have killed him to demand the ball down the stretch when they got to the playoffs? For Wilt, being the most productive player ever across multiple statistical categories (most impressively, he logged a ridiculous amount of minutes each year), somehow comes off as a limited achievement.

			<h1>Description of Issue</h1>
			<p> I also experienced this issue times as a team member and it influenced me a lot.
    It's a swaggeringly hot summer, we lost an important game of the tournament. Hearing the harsher and harsher quarrel, I didn't even want to remember any moment of the game just happened. 
    That's the semifinal game of the tournament, everyone had a great confidence to win the game since we think we have a greater talent than them. But the things didn't go as we want. After we waste a lot of chance to shoot the difficult jump shoot and three point, we found they had been lead us at least 10 points and it's hard to outrun them. At that time, we lost the right mood and strategy to fight. We didn't pass the ball and our defense became easy to break. The score-gap between us became bigger and bigger. When they made the game-winning shot, we really lost in deep desperation. We lost the game. Apparently, we can't go forward the tournament. The whole class kept scary silence and it's really a tough afternoon to rethink our performance and the reason we lost.
    The sun rose as usual next day, everything seemed back to normal. Suddenly, a sound of basketball break the silence when we were having lunch. That's our coach, also our head teacher. "I want to show you something" he said peacefully to us. That's a part of a movie, mainly talked about a team overcame the difficulties and played as a whole, tried their best to achieved their goals. Maybe it's an old story, but seeing the movement in the movie, we really feel the inspiration to figure what we should do. "You want to win, don't you?" He asked and take 5 basketballs out, "so we need more team-consciousness. That's a gift I want to give you, and I hope you remember: when you can consider others they would considerate you, when you help them they will help you, pass the ball to who have the best position to score. 
    That's a big shock to us. It's true, basketball is a teamwork games, and we can not win big without everyone's efforts even in the highest level such as NBA. Actually, we are not that good as them so it's more difficult to beat other team individually. Everyone should rotate the ball and that's the only way to succeed. Seeing the ball he gave us, we finally realize the way to our future. Now it's time for us to work hard and begin our road to self-salvation.
    The following months were tough but rich. We poured our heart into the teamwork training. We started with the easy pass training, although it's boring, we really want to do the best. Using the ball my coach gave us, we gradually experienced the real thing of basketball. After that hard work, I think we're ready to be the best five rather than five best any more in the future. The day before next tournament, our coach played with us and show us every details to win the game, how to fight as a team. In the end of the practice, he emphasized that we need to fight against ourselves, and talked about the importance of teamwork again. That time we really have the confidence to beat them using our teamwork skills - the most important core of basketball game.
    The next tournament came the following days. At first, we lost some points due to their unreasonable one-on-one play, just as we did last time. This nearly made us lose our sanity to fight individually as last time. But remembering the ball my coach gave us, remember the coach showed us, we got clear. Using the fancy and skillful passes and skills, we could break their offense easily and gradually led the game to our pace. After the final shoot made by our fancy teamwork skills, we finally won the champion. It is the victory of our hard work and also the victory of the teamwork spirit.
    We stood next to each other smiling happily, finally we solved the issue about teamwork and Tears welled in my eyes as I never felt so proud in my life. </p>

			<h1>Anticipated Effects</h1>
			<p>v</p>
		</article  After this experience I believed teamwork much more than ever. Not only the basketball game, but also the social society need the spirit of cooperation culture. As for me, sports offers the best example and I hope and I can get benefit from it in the future life outside basketball.

			<h1>Conclusion</h1>
			<p>For conclusion, to succeed at the task in hand everyone involved needs to combine their efforts. If everyone does their job well, then it increases what the team can accomplish. This teamwork has to be recognized by everyone and know that great things can happen if individuals master the fundamentals and work together as one unit. Everyone has their own unique role, but each person's individual role must be recognized and appreciated.
    I think teamwork is something that must be a high priority and given constant attention. Every player needs to understand how important it is for them to work smoothly together if they want to be successful. Each player must be dedicated to the whole team and be willing to act unselfishly. When challenges arise (as they always do), the team needs to have the resources, accountability and commitment to deal with them in a constructive and positive manner. A sense of teamwork will play an integral part in this.
