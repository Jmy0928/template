			<h1>Description of Issue</h1>
			<p>It's a swaggeringly hot summer, we lost an important game of the tournament. Hearing the harsher and harsher quarrel, I didn't even want to remember any moment of the game just happened. 
    That's the semifinal game of the tournament, everyone had a great confidence to win the game since we think we have a greater talent than them. But the things didn't go as we want. After we waste a lot of chance to shoot the difficult jump shoot and three point, we found they had been lead us at least 10 points and it's hard to outrun them. At that time, we lost the right mood and strategy to fight. We didn't pass the ball and our defense became easy to break. The score-gap between us became bigger and bigger. When they made the game-winning shot, we really lost in deep desperation. We lost the game. Apparently, we can't go forward the tournament. The whole class kept scary silence and it's really a tough afternoon to rethink our performance and the reason we lost.
    The sun rose as usual next day, everything seemed back to normal. Suddenly, a sound of basketball break the silence when we were having lunch. That's our coach, also our head teacher. "I want to show you something" he said peacefully to us. That's a part of a movie, mainly talked about a team overcame the difficulties and played as a whole, tried their best to achieved their goals. Maybe it's an old story, but seeing the movement in the movie, we really feel the inspiration to figure what we should do. "You want to win, don't you?" He asked and take 5 basketballs out, "so we need more team-consciousness. That's a gift I want to give you, and I hope you remember: when you can consider others they would considerate you, when you help them they will help you, pass the ball to who have the best position to score.</p> 
    <p>That's a big shock to us. It's true, basketball is a teamwork games, and we can no win big without everyone's efforts even in the highest level such as NBA. Actually, we are not that good as them so it's more difficult to beat other team individually. Everyone should rotate the ball and that's the only way to succeed. Seeing the ball he gave us, we finally realize the way to our future. Now it's time for us to work hard and begin our road to self-salvation.
    The following months were tough but rich. We poured our heart into the teamwork training. We started with the easy pass training, although it's boring, we really want to do the best. Using the ball my coach gave us, we gradually experienced the real thing of basketball. After that hard work, I think we're ready to be the best five rather than five best any more in the future. The day before next tournament, our coach played with us and show us every details to win the game, how to fight as a team. In the end of the practice, he emphasized that we need to fight against ourselves, and talked about the importance of teamwork again. That time we really have the confidence to beat them using our teamwork skills - the most important core of basketball game.
    The next tournament came the following days. At first, we lost some points due to their unreasonable one-on-one play, just as we did last time. This nearly made us lose our sanity to fight individually as last time. But remembering the ball my coach gave us, remember the coach showed us, we got clear. Using the fancy and skillful passes and skills, we could break their offense easily and gradually led the game to our pace. After the final shoot made by our fancy teamwork skills, we finally won the champion. It is the victory of our hard work and also the victory of the teamwork spirit.
    We stood next to each other smiling happily, Tears welled in my eyes as I never felt so proud in my life.</p> 
    <p>After this experience I believed teamwork much more than ever. Not only the basketball game, but also the social society need the spirit of cooperation culture. As for me, sports offers the best example and I hope and I can get benefit from it in the future life outside basketball.</p>
