		<p>Composing this issue</p>
<p>• What problems did you encounter in organizing and composing your documentary?</p>
<p>At first, we even don’t know how to organize the documentary because there should be too many things included. Then we have a big problem on filming scenes. We need to design the conversation and act it smoothly. </p>
<p>• What role did audience play? </p>
<p>Audience should be remind that they may also have the shopping addiction problem. </p>
        <p>Process</p> 
<p>• How did you select the issue/topic you chose?</p>
<p>Shopping addiction is a very normal problem in today’s society, people included my roommates are shopping all the time. That raise our awareness and make us interested in selecting this project. </p> 
<p>• What was the most challenging part of the project for you? Why?</p> 
<p>The most challenging part of the project is the filming part. We filmed several video parts in meridian mall and I act as a friend of shopaholic. It’s my first time to act and we have lot’s of conversations. It’s a challenge for me to memory the words and act confidently. </p>
<p>• Did you take a systematic approach? </p>
<p>I think yes, we did a systematic plan before. Firstly we discuss and design the scene and the conversation. Then we went to mall filming it and did my roommate's interview. Finally remix it using Imovie.</p>
        <p>Research</p>
<p>• Which research resources proved to be the most beneficial for you?</p> 
<p>I think the most beneficial resources is the former project by Shi and the youtube videos . It provided several resources included issues background and solutions.  </p>
<p>• Which ones proved to be the least beneficial?</p> 
<p>I think the least beneficial one is the cartoon in the remix. It doestn’t do a good job on showing the shopping addiction.</p>
        <p>Collaboration</p> 
<p>• Describe the interaction of your group in completing this project? </p>
<p>I think we cooperated very well in this project. Everyone interviewed their roommates and we film the short video in mall together. </p>
<p>• Was working in groups for this project fruitful? Why or why not? </p>
<p>Yes, sure. Working in groups for this is fruitful. Because firstly it’s more efficient to work in groups. We can distribute the task to everyone so that we can devote more into each’s parts.Then working in groups makes this project interesting. There may happened many funny things when we work together and I can imagine the boring when filming and remix the video by ourselves.</p>
        <p>Project Management</p> 
<p>• How well did you plan your work on this project?</p> 
<p>I think the initial plan is good. We planned a what to do list and do everyday’s mission smoothly. Finally we finished this project efficiently and on time.</p>
<p>• If you were to do it over again or if you had had more time, what might you have done differently? </p>
<p>If I have more time, I will interview more people not only in the mall but also in lansing area to get more resources. We will also propose a survey online and get more examples and solutions to the shopping addiction. We will also film more scenes and make the sound more clearly. </p>
        <p>Documentary Design</p> 
<p>• What is the most effective aspect of your documentary’s effectiveness or design? Why? </p>
<p>I think the most effective aspect of our documentary is the filming scene. We designed the conversation and the gesture to show the shopaholic's real mental world. In the solution part, the scenes are also effective because it can show it straightforward. </p>
<p>• How did you make your design decisions? </p>
<p>Firstly, we viewed lots of videos on youtube and find some behaviour of the shopaholic and also designed the conversation reference the friends who have the same problem. Then we began to write down the script and the monologue. Then we designed the three solutions to the shopping addiction and read commentary to accompany the solution scene.</p>
