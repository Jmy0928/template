			<h1>Proposed Solution</h1>
			<p>Solution from reality. One of the hoop speaker called Beckley Mason wrote a passage about “know your role”. He wrote: 
    “I am no psychologist and do not presume to know the root motivations for Wilt’s life. However the style of the book, written conversationally in Wilt’s voice and given to an unstable rhythm of mostly factual narrative and personal introspection, invites such analysis of the decisions he made, and the roles he’d chosen to that point in his life.”
    As articulated by Mile Durkheim, the concept of “roles” in society seeks to explain how the combination of others’ expectations and each individual’s own relationship with those expectations governs our thoughts and behaviors. This tension, sometimes manifested in “social facts” such as laws or religious tenets or social norms, creates social constraints that can have a coercive effect on the behavior of the individual. In Durkheim’s model, it doesn’t matter whether the individual actually assents to these facts. That is, inclusion (whether voluntary or otherwise) in a team, family, group, or as a member of society at large presupposes a constraint on individual will and freedom.</p>
    <p>The idea of roles on the basketball court, as in society, relies to no small degree on tradition. He felt that he was judged too harshly by coaches, teammates and especially “the press,” who he saw as disseminators of bogus storylines that portrayed Wilt as the evil Goliath figure. In the face of unfair perceptions that his physical gifts should allow him to singlehandedly control the outcomes of games, Wilt seems to have focused on what he knew he could control: individual achievements.</p>
