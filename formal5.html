			<p>Pollutant transport across the Pacific is only one of many intercontinental pathways of pollutant transport. In this research they also find numerous routes exist within the Pacific region, but transport on the mid-latitude westerly winds is dominant. The pollutants may be particles or gases and include coal combustion aerosols, ozone and heavy metals.
    During the environmental research, there are maybe some insufficient observational data to provide more than a sketchy picture of transport routes and concentrations. The Pacific Exploratory Mission (PEM) conducted in 1991 and 1994, were among the first large-scale programs to investigate long-range transport of pollutants in the Pacific. Pollutant outflow from the Asian continent into the air masses above the Pacific is found to be highest in the winter and spring seasons and the transit times across the Pacific usually range from 5 to 10 days depending on altitude and weather patterns (J.M hoell et al). Soil dust transported from Asia has been observed at Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii for over 30 years; high concentrations of anthropogenic pollutants have also been measured (K. D. Perry et al).
    A Computer simulations is also needed to support the research in environmental science analysis. Especially in this case, the computer simulation of trans-Pacific air pollution transport is numerous. When you focus on one study, between three and five important pollution events associated with meteorological disturbances that entrain pollution from Europe and Asia into westerly winds hit the U.S. west coast between February and May each year (J. Yienger et al). Another study finds that a tripling of east Asian anthropogenic emissions from fossil fuel combustion by 2010 compared with 1985 levels could increase ground level monthly mean ozone concentrations in the western United States by 2 to 6 parts per billion (ppb), which makes achievement of the new U. S. ozone standard more difficult (J Jacob et al).
    In another side, Pollutant concentrations in snow, fish, wildlife, sediments, and Arctic inhabitants also indicate that some substances transported into and across the Pacific may already be working their way into ecosystems and humans. A study on the Fraser River watershed in British Columbia concluded that toxic airborne pollutants from Asia may be a source of contamination in lake fish and sediments (Blais et al.) found surprisingly high POP concentrations in the snowpack of high mountains in the Canadian west. Other studies document POPs and mercury in wildlife and human populations in the Arctic (AMAP), pesticides in bald eagles of the Aleutian island (R. G. Anthony et al).
    In all of these cases, the origin of the pollutants is undetermined, but long-range atmospheric transport across the Pacific Ocean cannot be ruled out. There are a lot of researches keep tracking. For example, the TRACE-P experiment (Transport and Chemical Evolution over the Pacific) aim to quantify the properties and distribution of aerosols and other atmospheric species in the Asia-Pacific region. The Intercontinental Transport and Chemical Transformation of Anthropogenic Pollution (ITCT) project will focus on atmospheric transport and chemistry over the North Atlantic and North Pacific. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and other government agencies are planning atmospheric inflow studies to the west coast of the United States.
    Research of the long-range transport, deposition, and impacts of atmospheric pollutants in the Pacific region is only beginning of the environmental research. In the environmental science field, we should not only explore the origin and transport ways of a pollutant affecting envir4onmental system, but also we need to find their effects on humans’ health, which is a more important mission for environmental science. </p>
