<p>•     The video we viewed during class purposed to spread an true thing that gay people is in the same circumstances as the author. It’s directed towards gay men and women living in Evangelical communities. In this community, being gay is seen as unforgivable. Homosexuals in these community will be told the relation end up and rejected by their families. The author also feels helpless but he want to strive for it instead of giving up. He talked though this video with a series of  spoken and written words to show his determination. In the beginning of the video, it display the background information on a board with silent music. That is the author's experience before. Then it appears a letter which was written by his uncle said he should taking his own life. Then it shows how it feels to be a homosexual in the community and the effect. These two stories from the video both show a strong message for people in the similar gay positions. I think this video is make to all the people struggled in the situation. By viewing this video and seeing how the author writing and organizing the narrative help me to revise my own. I learned it’s important to show the background, it can help developing the story. Then some comparison and the real example to making the story more detailed. </p>

<p>•     In the past, I really don’t think I’m a good at writing and now I’m in college in america, it’s a skill that I need to work on. Writing is a part of life and the fundamental of the research. As a engineering students, although writing classes are difficult for us, they will help you develop as a professional engineer. To create the projects, students must research, write, read, and communicate. All of the skills are very necessary to be successful in upper level education. I hope to learn techniques to make my writing better. Seeing the course website, I know we will do five projects which include the Lived Experiences Project, the Cultural Analysis Project, the Formal Research Project, the Multimedia Remix Project and the Course Retrospective Project. I’m really looking forward the remix project because I can use imovie again and make a video. Step by step, today I’m going to start doing the first one. In this project, I will Identify an academic career track for myself and describe one piece of technology that has led you to your choice. </p>
        <p>3</p>
<p>•     When I was studying in China, we used to write essays on a paper. But in america, we always type in the computer to finish project. Digital text is much different. Actually, I can do anything with digital text in less time. This digital text helped me saving time to write paper. Technology from code will grow greatly through the internet. Through those new technologies, we can learn more quickly and it can even correct our mistakes or typos. I’m very thankful to have these intelligence things around. Without the web, our society will postponed and I wouldn’t go on my life. This technology also increase my spare time and update the world. Without social media, we will not know what happened that fast. Like Weibo in china, a pop star can rise millions of comments for one post and that’s the strong influence. It also reduce paper which can protect the environment. So I think it’s a good model for us and we need to keep improving the internet and it will do good to our civilization. </p>
        <p>4</p> 
<p>•     I continued to work on the project one. To write a story that lead my career is difficult. Fortunately, I have a exact experience which lead me to biology field during my high school. My story was about SARS. Firstly I described this disease and how severe it is. Then I choose to add more details about the hard time scared by that. Then I mentioned even till now, there is no cure or protective vaccine for SARS which is safe for use in humans. The importance of Biology came to my eyes and I really want to learn better and deeper knowledge. Then I told a story about model cars in the second half. It has always been my favorite thing to do. I explain the relation between model car modification and engineering skills. For example, I used to rebuild the motor of the mode cars, which is the same as we do in the engineering class. This year, we did the EGR100 lego robot project and to set a program and remodel the motor is a very important part of it. I like doing engineering things.</p>

<p>•     So far, the peer review for this project is great. It’s great way to learn from others. This week I got some feedback said what I should add and what is no use and should be taken out. They also help me to change the structure and I’m able to see their point and try to correct it. Analysis is the ability to understand why writing about something is so important, it a big gain for me. Though this review, it can give me confidence and lead me to correct the mistakes. At the same time, I can also learn things from seeing others’ paper. From their papers, I learned the new structure and how to organize the paper.  This peer review online is a great way to learn and have fun at the same time. I hope people can put time in it and fully consider the advantages and disadvantages so that we can learn more thing from the peer review and get the most fun possible. Then this week we finally completed our lived experience project and are now moving to our cultural analysis project. </p>
        <p>6</p> 
<p>•     I am enjoying this assignment two because I am learning more about not only writing but also my cultural issue. The objective of the project is to select an artifact of popular culture (a video game, a music video, a movie, a TV show, etc.) and explain how that artifact illustrates or depicts either a group of people or your social issue. Finally, propose a solution that helps or possibly solves the social issue in question. This project was harder because it gives you a ton of freedom on what you are allowed to pick then just find something to talk about in it, but through the analysis of a cultural artifact, you should investigate a specific social issue and its import on society. I choose to talk about selfish and cooperation using a experience in my high school. Firstly I want to described the game we lost and especially focus on what we thought after lost and how my coach told us. Then I choose to add more details about the hard work training after it and how we finally win the tournament. After that I’d like to show that we can use the teamwork spirit not only in basketball game but also everywhere when we study and work. I gave some examples such as cooperation at school and when we work in the future we can use the spirit to win big. In the end I reassert my main theme again in the last paragraph and show my determination to develop my teamwork skills. </p>
        <p>7</p>
<p>•     This week I just began to start the Codecademy tracks for the course. So far I have completed track 1 to track 7. It has helped me get how the skills of how to build a website using coding html, but I am still very confused with it.  I have learned introduction to HTML structures, and introduction to CSS. These are very helpful websites and I would recommend future students to really take advantage of it. I describe in details and you can see every code and its function clearly. Actually, just as far as I am concerned, Codecademy is not very helpful even though it hasn’t taught me something I need to know and our teacher recommend it. It’s not very friendly if you fail to do one step. That is if you fail, you can’t any other tracks and you will suck there. So I think there should be more information that we need to know to be covered in class instead of just suck in one step. I think we should have gone over more things in class about it so that we can get more help with it, especially because most of us students have clue how to do it or just suck with one track.</p>
        <p>8</p>
<p>•     This week we finish doing culture analysis project in the following sections. Firstly I want to described the game we lost and especially focus on what we thought after lost and how my coach told us. Which is the Background analysis and describe the issue that is the cooperation spirit. Then I choose to add more details about the hard work training after it and how we finally win the tournament. (In this part I detailed the importance of teamwork and the proposed solution ) After that I showed that we can use the teamwork spirit not only in basketball game but also everywhere when we study and work. I gave some examples such as cooperation at school and when we work in the future we can use the spirit to win big. In the end I reassert my main theme again for conclusion in the last paragraph and show my determination to develop my teamwork skills. As for me, this assignment is a very good review for me and recall my experience that how to be a succeed man in the future. It also helped me to rethink the thing I’m doing now, I forget the importance of some work and now I’m pretty sure that only via cooperation can we achieve the higher goals.</p>

<p>•     Now we finished the culture analysis project and started to work on our formal research projects. This is the longest project in this semester and we need to write a 3000 words research paper. As the background saying,many students come to higher education with only a vague idea of what it means to become a participating member of an academic discipline. I think it’s my obligation to give students who are new to the academic field an introduction to the expectations for writing, reading, and researching in that discipline. In preparation this project, I want to introduces the students to the ways that research and participating in important biology academic discussions. I think this project should be the one I learned the most. Because you get to research the major you have chosen which for most people the field they plan on going into. On class, we did the Library Activity and the Annotated Bibliography, this two things allow us to know how to site and fully use our school’s resources.</p>
        <p>10</p>
<p>•	 We continue working on the formal research paper. In this essay, the target is to give students who are new to the academic field you have chosen an introduction to the expectations for writing, reading, and researching in that discipline. For me that field was biology. I knew a little before actually, I just know my aunt works for FDA and nothing more. In order to do it deeply, I read lots of biology website I could find and I now know everything we will do as a biology researchers. Now I have a good understanding of what it really takes to be successful in this field eventually. We are also asked to conduct 2 interviews, one with a person who teaches courses in the field of study, and one with a person who practices in the field. For this requirement, I conducted my aunt’s friend, who is a professor for biology in MSU and a professor in my hometown Beijing. The interview doing well and I learned a lot from them. For the analysis of the paper, it’s a really huge work to do. Luckily, we had an in class activity that helped me out a lot with this project regarding the articles. That in class activity really helped us find the right articles for our papers and also taught us how to search with a purpose by finding articles that relate to our papers with the internet.</p>
        <p>11</p>	
<p>•     Finally we finished the longest paper- the formal research paper. Now we head for the most interesting part of this semester, the remix project. This project is an opportunity to revise and transmediate one of your earlier projects, strengthening the original purpose of the piece while transforming it into an alternative form of a short documentary. Because the work must be based on either the Lived Experiences Report, Cultural Analysis Proposal, or Formal Research Report by someone in the group. We finally choose the culture project bu Shi. It’s about shopping addiction. Because Shopping addiction is a very normal problem in today’s society, people included my roommates are shopping all the time. That raise our awareness and make us interested in selecting this project. Then we had a meeting in akers to make a to do list for this documentary. Hope we can finish it on time.</p>
        <p>12</p>
<p>•     On class, we watched a commercial by chrysler and it shocked me. This commercial is actually not only made for the Chrysler 200 but also for the motor city- Detroit. To make it usual, the commercial doesn’t try to portrait what Detroit has been through, instead the creators chose to think of Detroit’s past as a building block that has made it a much stronger city. At the same time, the Chrysler 200 will be seen to be a strong car. This commercial use several strategies. Like the voiceover starts with a couple of questions, like "What does a town that’s been to hell and back know about the finer things in life?" This question and tongue can easily gets people's emotional if they can relate, such as if they have ever lived in Detroit, or was ever affected by the economy crisis. The voiceovers tone is really perfect to put the people in that environment. The background song lose yourself by Eminem is really fit the video. He was raised and origin in Detroit, it show the pride. Eminem is to show that even though Detroit is declining, good future can still come out of the city and michigan. In the end, the line “Imported from Detroit” sends a very strong message to viewers that to be confident and have positive thoughts about the city as well as the car. I really learned a lot from this video.</p>
        <p>13</p>
<p>•     This weekend we went to the meridian mall to filmt our remix part. Actually  I think it is the most challenging part of the project.  We filmed several video parts in meridian mall and I acted as a friend of shopaholic. It’s my first time to act and we had lot’s of conversations. It’s a challenge for me to memory the words and act confidently. lot’s of people are seeing me and I really feel nervous in the mall. I have to say, working in groups for this project is fruitful. Because firstly it’s more efficient to work in groups. We can distribute the task to everyone so that we can devote more into each’s parts. Then working in groups makes this project interesting. There may happened many funny things when we work together and I can imagine feeling boring when filming and remix the video by ourselves. Then it’s time to remix it together. Firstly we download a commercial by microsoft and put it in the beginning of the video, then we began to clip our filming parts together and add the solution to the shopping addiction. Finally we finished it before due date and upload it to youtube. It’s seems awesome and now it was seen by 20 more people in youtube.com. We feel very proud of it.</p>
        <p>14</p>
<p>•     Finally we are already working on our last project for this class. It seems all those project went so quickly. This last assignment for class consists of two parts. Firstly, we will write a final progress report for this course that revisits and revises the individual literacy history for a specific purpose of revisiting and revising for the purpose of helping incoming students understand the big picture of First-Year Writing to enhance their chances of success in the Program. For this part, It’s interesting to rethink the advantages and disadvantages before. As saying goes, wise man reflect themselves three times every day. Secondly, we need to as a class, create a website that informs and advises incoming students about WRA 110 using the content generated by the individual papers described. The website should include an explanation of all four key assignments as well as the advice for incoming students. I enrolled the website team and take the obligation to design the webpage. After learning the Codecademy I feel confident to design and I’m sure the group can finish the last mission successfully. </p>

<p>•     This is my second semester at MSU and it is coming to an end now. Honestly, it’s the most  amazing semester and also the most tired semester I have ever had. I got five classes and half of them is really hard like MTH235, but, I gain a lot. For the writing class, I have learned a ton that I can carry on throughout my life in pursuing my dreams. The five projects in the class were a huge change for me. I remember at first, I even can’t imagine how to write a three thousands words paper, but now I can write this blog to show my gain very smoothly and confidently. Throughout the semester, so many people and resources helped me. The peer reviewer's feedback and teacher’s email give me the direction to be succeed. The teammate of remix project helped me overcome nervous to act in the mall. We did a very great job, thank you. Through this course, I also learned how to collect, analyze and share information, It give me more confident to study in the higher level courses in my discipline. In the end, I learned how to share information and opinions with others. Thanks to all my classmates and our professor Daniels. I’m so glad that I was able to be a part of this class and I will never forget it. Thanks for giving directions and I hope I can keep improving my writing and analyze skills in the future.</p>
