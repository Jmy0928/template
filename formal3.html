			<h1>Background Information</h1>
			<p>These years, severe air pollution comes with the development of technology and industry. Even from 1990 to 2010 those twenty years, Asian pacific area increases three times of the carbon dioxide emission (Energy information administration). And those pollutants are now at a high speed spreading though the Pacific Rim to America continent.
    The once-pure air above the North Pacific Ocean is polluted. As an environmental researcher, you will be expected to explore many branches of this issue. For example, you are expected to explore how the pollutants are transported from Asia to the Pacific Ocean basin and across to North America. Because as the expected economic expansion around the Pacific Rim will deliver even more pollution unless preventative measures are taken. The risk of adverse effects to wildlife, ecosystems, climate, and human health throughout the Pacific region will increase. The pollution will affect even remote areas such as Arctic and alpine environments. Ocean productivity and the atmospheric energy budget over the North Pacific Ocean could also be altered.
    In order to find the ways pollutant transported, researchers tried to get and use the observation from all across the continent. Like in 1997, rapid transport of pollutants from Asia to the Olympic Peninsula of Washington State was observed (D. Jaffe et al). And in April 1998, satellite remote sensing showed aerosols being whisked across the Pacific to North America from a massive dust storm in western China (see the figure below) (http://capita.wustl.edu/). At this time, the observational data, computer simulations, and research on pollutant concentrations in various media could provided additional evidence of a potential pan-Pacific air quality problem.
