			<h1>Research Section</h1>
			<p>According to the 2006 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), nearly 80% of the Children in the United States are generally healthy. However, a significant proportion of children are affected by respiratory conditions, including allergies, which are associated with missed school days and activity limitations (M. Blaiss). Parent responses to questions in the 2006 NHIS indicate that about 9% of children younger than 18 years old had respiratory allergies (B. Bloom, R. Cohen). These estimates are higher than comparable statistics from the 1982 NHIS, where 5.5% of children were reported to have allergic in the previous 12 months (NCHS).
    That’s a typical environmental issue in our daily life. This kind of issue is always including an interaction of physical, chemical, and biological processes. As an environmental students you should always bring a systems approach to the analysis of environmental problems.
    In this environmental problem, a possible factor we think affecting respiratory allergic symptoms is exposure to surrounding air pollution, particularly traffic pollutants in the city. Reviews of the effects of air pollution on allergies have concluded that pollutants likely make effects of allergens among those with existing susceptibility, rather than initiating allergies among people without existing allergies.
    There are some experimental evidences to analysis. For example, exposure to fuel particles may increase allergic response (Knox et al) and a recent review of experimental studies outlines possible pathways for these effects. 
    No comprehensive studies have examined associations between allergic symptoms and air pollution among a nationwide sample of the U.S. children. When facing this, the specific pollution exposures studied as well as other place-specific factors, such as local flora, may contribute to the differences in findings.
    Across the United States, for example, pollen varieties and seasonal impact varies. An intriguing study by (Mutius et al) documented the change in the incidence of seasonal allergic after the reunification of Germany. Before reunification, allergies and asthma were less common in East Germany, an area with more industrial pollution than in West Germany. Yet the west part of Germany got more traffic pollution. After reunification, allergies, but not asthma, increased among children in East Germany as East Germany’s living conditions became more westernized, including more traffic. In a recent review, it concluded that the evidence linking traffic-related air pollutants and allergic rhinitis is equivocal (Heinrich, Whichmann).
    In this study, the data from the 1999–2005 NHIS that had been geographically linked to annual air monitoring data for several pollutants from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA). With both air pollution and allergen levels expected to rise with global climate change, understanding the potential consequences for children’s well-being is important both now and in the future.
    Then environmental researchers should have the ability making a table just like the picture below (Environmental Health Perspectives). In this issue research, it’s in order to significantly associate with respiratory allergies as demonstrated by statistics without consideration of multiple comparisons.</p>

    <p>Using the combined outcome analysis, 19.2% of these children ages between 3 to 17 years are reported to have respiratory allergy, or within the previous 12 months of this group, 11.4% reported hay fever, 12.8% reported respiratory allergy, and 5% reported both conditions. 
    To explore the issue of environmental science, you should always focus on varies links between each factors. In this case, the number of children linked to air monitoring data varies by pollutant. Of the eligible 72,279 children, 32,137 had exposure data for each of these pollutants within 20 miles, and 47,989 had exposure data for both PM10 and PM2.5, allowing an approximate estimate of the coarse PM exposure by the difference (PM2.5–10 = PM10 levels – PM2.5 levels). In all groups, respiratory allergy reporting was slightly lower than in the overall sample of children, ranging from 18.3% for children linked to NO2 to 19.0% for children linked to PM2.5 (Parker, Akinbami, and Woodruff). There are small demographic differences and larger geographic differences among the linkage subsets.
    In single-pollutant models, associations were significantly different by urban–rural status for O3, PM10, and PM2.5–10, but not for PM2.5 or the other gaseous pollutants. 
    O3 had a slightly stronger effect on reporting of respiratory allergy in the more urban areas compared with the small metropolitan and rural areas, whereas PM10 and PM2.5–10 had slightly stronger associations in medium and fringe metropolitan areas (Parker, Akinbami, Woodruff).
    The Key elements of an effective environmental research also need to include the ability to relate space, and time relationships as well as quantitative analysis.
    Given the differences in reporting respiratory allergy by child’s race, family poverty status, and child’s age and sex, the researchers also examined interactions to determine whether associations for O3 and PM variables differed by these factors. Model results with interaction terms indicated that associations did not differ by race/ethnicity, sex, or age category for either PM or summer O3. Associations did not differ significantly by poverty status for PM variables, but the associations between O3 exposure and respiratory allergy for children in poverty categories beyond the twice of poverty were stronger than for those below of poverty. (Parker, Akinbami, Woodruff)
    Comparing with the results for the O3 with those using the annual averages of the daily 8-hr running O3 averages provided by the U.S. EPA. These averages were lower than the summer averages but highly correlated despite the differing O3 reporting periods throughout the United States, the use of average daily measurement to calculate the O3 variable, and the use of daily 8-hr averages to calculate the annual O3 variable. Corresponding to the high correlation, the association between annual O3 exposure and respiratory allergy adjusted for demographic and geographic factors was similar to that reported for O3.
    Finally, the models that included adult smoking shows in the eligible sample, 20.3% of children lived in a family with a known smoker. Although adult smoking in the family had an independent effect on respiratory allergy, its inclusion in the models did not affect associations between respiratory allergy and either PM2.5 or O3.
    Then, the results agree with the findings in the article: exposures to O3 and fine PM are associated with childhood respiratory allergies. The findings from environmental researchers support detailed monitoring of air quality as high levels of exposure are increasingly being demonstrated as unsafe to public health and costly in terms of morbidity, lost school and work days, and lower quality of life.
    The big environmental system we live nearby is the biggest system in North America-the great lake system. It’s now also suffering from the pollution. More than 1 billion kilograms (1,061,751,370 kg) of pollutants, linked to smog, acid rain, respiratory illnesses and damage to human’s development, were emitted into the air in 2002 by Canadian facilities in the Great Lakes basin (Canadian environmental law association). These findings are contained in a new report released on June 9 (National Clean Air Day) by Environmental Defense and the Canadian Environmental Law Association. The report reveals that the Great Lakes basin was home to 45% of all toxic air pollution reported in Canada in 2002.
    Environmental science provides quantitative approach to the study of environmental systems. It incorporates more of the social sciences for understanding human relationships, perceptions and policies towards the environment    
    "Canadian regulators are asleep at the switch to control pollution in the Great Lakes", said Paul Muldoon, Executive Director, and Canadian Environmental Law Association.
    To help the policy changing and improve the environment, a new feature on the Pollution Watch Web site lists the top 10 facilities in the Great Lakes basin releasing pollutants to the air. This includes criteria air contaminants linked with smog, and toxic air pollutants.</p>
