		<p>Biology is a nature science of the study of life. It’s known as one of the top area of nature science and there are still so many knowledge seems mysterious to our human beings. I want to indent my career track as an engineer of biology, just like those scientists who explore this area in the past and make contributions to our life now. It’s our engineers’ responsibility to explore the unknown world and make this research beneficial to us. My technical object is follow my track to be a biology engineer and do something positive for human’s heath and quality level of life.
I love plants and animals when I was very young. At that time, teachers always publicity that world is our family and we are all the earth’s citizens. That’s correct, as a earth’s member, we should take the obligation to improve ourselves. The mysterious such as the origin of human and how to transfer the genetic attracted me a lot. But the thing that made me firm the idea to be a biology researcher is a catastrophe happened in 2004’s China.
In 2004, an outbreak of disease happened in
China and spread to all over the world. This disease is called Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) which caused an eventual 8300 cases and 775 deaths. I was studying at the first year’s middle school at that time and this disaster experience influenced me a lot. Since SARS is a viral disease, the antibiotics are ineffective, treatment of SARS was largely supportive with antipyretics and supplemental oxygen. That’s apparently can not be a targeted treatment methods so the death rate of SARS was very high. SARS also has a high mortality rate, so suspected cases of SARS must be isolated, with complete barrier nursing. Due to the high risk, the China’s government was forced to build an all new temporary hospital in the suburb near highway. They did a great job finishing the new hospital in only one month. But another problems came. How to transfer the patients. In order to transfer patient in efficient way, the patients in the city center’s hospital will be transfer only at night. Since all the schools closed during the outbreaking time, I moved to my grandma’s house in the suburb. But it’s near the highway which is the main road to the temporary hospital. This special location made me knows more about what a severe catastrophe
it is.
Actually I can’t describe my feeling in several
sentences. It is a kind of nameless fear. Life continues normal before night, but when the traffic get better after 8pm, there will be hundreds of ambulances driving along the highway to the isolated hospital in the suburb. That’s really feared me when heard those bell’s ringing. Hearing those high pitch sound, I can even felt the epinephrine raced though my body. From that moment, I realized how fragile is human’s life and how many science principle we still don’t know. Not overstate that Beijing was just like an empty city during that spring. Workers from other provinces got back and there were only Beijing residents stood by this huge city and encouraged each other. This experience in my childhood shocked me a lot. Fortunately, our families did a great job prevent the disease. Even till now, there is no cure or protective vaccine for SARS which is safe for use in humans. The importance of Biology came to my eyes and I really want to learn better and deeper knowledge. I hope I can use the knowledges I gained to do my research and make it fight against human disease.
I also have a great interest in engineering
design and build. Once upon a time, the car model was very popular among the middle school students in Beijing. I was also deeply attracted by those awesome cars. The parts most awesome is that we can design the appearance of the car and build all the model by ourselves. At first, I can just model some easy parts like wheels and the coverage. But apparently we can’t satisfied just design the appearance. Seeing the higher grade students’ car can run much faster than us, I found they can design the core component, like the engine of cars. It’s amazing to me and attracted me a lot. After the admiration, I began my way to design my own car.
Firstly, I went to the car store every week to learn how to design engines. Procedure by procedure, I gradually figured the axioms of car’s engine. Then I began trying to buy a new rotor and a better magnet. As my investigation, the engine’s performance depends on magnetic force of rotor and it’s the core knowledge of engine. It’s a difficult process because I can’t figure out if the parts works well and can fit each other. In order to get the best parts to build my car, I tried to get familiar with the boss and the technology support clerk. After couple weeks, I
finally got the model number of the best performance rotors. Gears are also very important to an engine, then I began to renovate the gear of engine. As I know, the ratio of gears determined the speed and torque force, so I need to adapt it day and night to find a great ratio. I remember that it was a very frustrated time. If you add too much ratio, the engine itself will got hot and reduced speed automatically. But when you subtract ratio, it’s got slower. After times and times test on the track, I finally got the appropriate ratio and can run the car as far as possible. Finally, hull changed. It’s now the easiest part and I painted some colors I liked on it. Because my name’s initials is JM, I just put a sticker called JM NO.1 to show my name and the expectation I gave it. It’s my first model car as well as I believe It can run as number one.
I kept my interest till attending university. I confirmed that I will follow the biology engineering’s track in my future. I love modeling and designing and I feel it is happy to develop it. In the future studies, I will try my best to carry my advantages and try to do more deep research in biology. That’s why I indent my major as bio- engineering at MSU. It’s has a good school of engineering. I want to develop my engineering
skills and knowledge about biology there and I have confident I can do well In my way pursuing the final goal: that’s to do something positive solving the mysterious of the biology world and explore more effective methods to help human against the disease and have a better life in the future.
